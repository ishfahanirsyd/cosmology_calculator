# cosmology_calculator

This code calculates various cosmological parameters, such as the scale factor, redshift, comoving distance, angular diameter distance (DA), and luminosity distance (DL), for different cosmological models. The three specific cases considered are:

- **Matter-only universe**: Where the universe is dominated by matter (Ω_m = 1.0, Ω_Λ = 0.0).
- **Empty universe**: A universe with no matter or dark energy (Ω_m = 0.0, Ω_Λ = 0.0).
- **Lambda-only universe**: A universe dominated by dark energy (Ω_m = 0.0, Ω_Λ = 1.0).

You can change the values of the density parameters (Ω_m, Ω_Λ) and curvature (k) as needed, allowing for flexibility in exploring different cosmological models, including more complex combinations of matter, dark energy, and curvature.

In each case, the code numerically integrates to compute the evolution of the scale factor and other parameters over cosmic time (tau). The results are compared with known analytical solutions where applicable.

### Specific Redshift Values:
In addition to the general evolution of these parameters, we will show their values at specific redshift points for each cosmological model. This allows us to examine how distances and the Hubble parameter vary across different epochs of the universe for the three cases mentioned. Additionally, we will plot a comparison between the analytical and numerical values to visualize how closely the numerical integration matches the known analytical solutions.
